# CS 170 Project Spring 2020

Requirements:

You'll only need to install networkx to work with the starter code. For installation instructions, follow: https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/install.html

Files:
- `parse.py`: functions to read/write inputs and outputs
- `solver.py`: calls all other solvers and return the optimal output
- `utils.py`: contains functions to compute cost and validate NetworkX graphs

To run the solver:
- cd into this project directory `network-alg-proj`
- Create a directory named `output`.
- Type `python3 run_all.py` to the command line. (This command will run all inputs stored in the `input` directory and write all output .out files into `output` directory.)
